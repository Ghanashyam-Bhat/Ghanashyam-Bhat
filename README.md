You could highlight this feature and emphasize how it helps students build skills, network with their peers, and increase their participation in college activities.

  2. Offering a cryptocurrency-based rewards system - Synergy's integration of blockchain technology to make credits a cryptocurrency is another unique feature that could set it apart from other campus-focused apps. You could highlight the benefits of using a cryptocurrency-based system, such as increased security, transparency, and ease of use.

  3. Providing a platform for freelancing and entrepreneurship - By promoting a culture of freelancing and entrepreneurship within the university, Synergy could differentiate itself from other campus-focused apps. You could emphasize how Synergy provides a platform for students to showcase their skills, connect with potential clients, and build a portfolio of work.

  4. Creating a user-friendly interface and experience - Finally, to make Synergy more appealing to users, you could focus on creating a user-friendly interface and experience that is easy to navigate and use. This could involve incorporating features such as personalized dashboards, notifications, and a simple and intuitive design.
